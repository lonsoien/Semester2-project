## Goal
To create an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections. Both sections should be responsive and the website will be populated by a Strapi API supplied by Noroff.

## Brief
You are to build an e-commerce website. You can choose the theme of your website. It should follow the site architecture described.

Design your website using your favourite tool. You will need to find a suitable logo. If you decide to create a logo yourself, do not spend too much time on it.

You must apply all that you have learned in your studies so far. The site must have a good user experience and UI design, following today’s trends and design patterns.

Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.

Build admin pages to create, update and delete products.

The website must be responsive on all devices.

   # Summary 
   
This semester project was probably the most fun project of all tasks provided from school. Working with fun pictures/products and build an ecommerce site is something I learned I definatley will continue in real life as a deveopler. 
   
I found my skills and intereset for UI and UX design really got to apply for this project. I felt my personal style and the vision of a sneakers brand came across in my designing skills when building this project. All the colors, texts and layout I am most proud of. 

Also working with Strapi API with a cloudinary hosting was a good learning experience (saldy this hosting is no longer for free).
